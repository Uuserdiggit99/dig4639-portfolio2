This react native app is a Components Demo. 

It is meant as a way to show my proficiency in react as a collection of useful components. A couple components share similar concepts to previous assignments but I coded the components for this assignment from scratch to improve how they worked and to ensure maximum compatibility with Android and IOS.

I plan on adding more components before using this project in my actual portfolio.

Major Components: Login Screen with validation, Login Modal Window, Timer, Counter, Menu. 

There should be 6 screens including the login window modal. 
The "login window modal" is not the same component as the first login screen.

This project does use react navigation on every screen except the first. I hid the header on the other screens so the app looks better in the preview at the snack.expo.io link. 

If viewing on Android or ios on snack.expo.io please expand the preview for maximum visibility. The keyboard may need to be dismissed to see the submit button on the first screen as well. To do this, select the back button on Android or hit the "Return" button on the IOS keyboard.



The password for the login screen is “password”. Lower case, do not include the quotes.
